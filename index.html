                            My name is Fady Naguib. I was born and raised in Cairo, Egypt. After finishing
                            highschool,
                            I
                            decided to
                            move to
                            Arizona, where I had some family
                            living, in order to pursue a better future and a more luxurious career in the field of
                            chemical
                            enginerring.
                            After graduating from <a href="https://semte.engineering.asu.edu/chemical-engineering-bse/">Arizona
                                Sate
                                University</a> with a BSE of chemcial engineering in 2017, I began
                            looking at the different idustries and fields that interested me. As my research went
                            on, I
                            realized that
                            the
                            market for software developers
                            and software engineers was very hot. Now, during my engineering undergraduate days, I
                            often
                            was
                            very amazed
                            by
                            sotware such as MatLAB, which made
                            complex engineering calculations rather simple and less time consuming. I began liking
                            the
                            idea
                            of
                            developing
                            solutions to complex problems using
                            software, which led me to the coding bootcamp in University of Arizona.

                            I'm very glad I discovered my passion early on in life and am able to pursue an
                            immersive
                            program that can
                            teach me all the necessary skills and tools
                            in order to be successful in the path I chose to take. In this portfolio, I plan on
                            documenting
                            my path
                            towards
                            learning web development and turning my
                            passion into a successful career.
